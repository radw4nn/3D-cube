# Simple 3D Cube Renderer 🔳

This Python program is a simple implementation of a 3D cube renderer using OpenGL. It was created as a learning exercise to delve into mathematical concepts related to 3D graphics and to explore the OpenGL API for rendering.

## Usage ⌨️
- W -> Roatate the cube forward ⬆️
- A -> Rotate the cube leftward ⬅️
- S -> Rotate the cube backward ⬇️
- D -> Rotate the cube rightward ➡️

## Features ⚙️
- Draws a basic 3D cube in a window using OpenGL.
- Demonstrates fundamental concepts of 3D graphics rendering.
- Provides a starting point for experimenting with OpenGL.

## Motivation 🎯
The primary motivation behind creating this program was to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematics involved in 3D graphics rendering and to get hands-on experience with the OpenGL API. By visualizing a simple 3D object like a cube.

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x
- OpenGL library (PyOpenGL)

## Contributing
