# Simple 3D Cube Renderer ðŸ”³

This Python program is a simple implementation of a 3D cube renderer using OpenGL. It was created as a learning exercise to delve into mathematical concepts related to 3D graphics and to explore the OpenGL API for rendering.

## Features
- Draws a basic 3D cube in a window using OpenGL.
- Demonstrates fundamental concepts of 3D graphics rendering.
- Provides a starting point for experimenting with OpenGL.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind creating this program was to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematics involved in 3D graphics rendering and to get hands-on experience with the OpenGL API. By visualizing a simple 3D object like a cube, users can explore various aspects of 3D graphics, such as transformations, perspective, and shading.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenGL library (PyOpenGL)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements or would like to add features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the desire to learn more about 3D graphics rendering and OpenGL.
